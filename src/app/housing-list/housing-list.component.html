<!-- remember, here we're saying essentially for each location in locationLis,
and that locationList we have access to becuase it was passed in from app.html
and this component recieved it in the input var thing from this ones .ts and 
finally location objects are essentially defined in the housing-location.ts
and instantiated in the app.ts-->
